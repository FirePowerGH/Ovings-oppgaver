The first time you have a chance at the top is the second one you get a free pass and you can go on your way back and pick them all and they can get to your place or you can just go to the top 🔝 you just don’t know how much it would be for the second and you could get the first two but it would be like a hundred bucks more than what I get at my regular job but you could pay for the second one and then you could get it from the second and the third and the third and then the younger you got it for free you could get a free pet for the first two for a little bit more money 💰 but I would just pay for it and then you could pay me
